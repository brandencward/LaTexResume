# Automated Resume

This resume is written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) since I couldn't find a resume template that fit my needs. I took it a step further by adding CI/CD that utilizes my K8s raspberry pi cluster as a self hoted [runner](https://github.com/brandencward/runners). This was a great learning experience and a fun little project to help advance my skills.
